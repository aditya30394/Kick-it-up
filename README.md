## Introduction
In a world filled with brilliant entrepreneurs eager to make their ideas a reality, finding the funding necessary for such initiatives can be a challenging endeavour. Crowd-funding websites such as Kickstarter provide a way for savvy entrepreneurs to leverage the collective resources of the crowd to obtain the necessary capital to get their projects started. Kickstarter's core function is to act as a global crowd-funding platform where users (also known as backers) are offered tangible rewards or experiences in exchange for pledges of monetary support. While Kickstarter publishes many articles outlining best-practices for project creation, large scale analysis has shown that approximately half of all campaigns still fail.

We believe that meaningful indicators exist that can predict whether a project is more likely to get successfully funded as compared to others. By identifying these indicators, it is our goal to be able to provide insights into what types of decisions project creators should focus their scarce time and resources on. We believe that project creators across all categories would be able to use this information to inform their decisions and would both desire and benefit from these insights. 

We feel that there are many ideas that exist in the world that, for one reason or another, do not have the financial resources or social visibility to be recognized by the public. It is our hope that by providing information to project creators about what features are most predictive of a successful campaign that all good ideas will be given equal representation and net social good will be promoted through the flourishing of novel innovations. 

## Questions to Answer?
Through group discussion and previous literature review, we have determined that there are 4 main questions that we wish to address through this work. 
* Perform sentiment analysis on both the project 'blurb' and 'name' sections of each project to determine if there is any relationship between the predicted sentiment and the success or failure of the project (need to define 'blurb' and 'name' at some point). 
* Determine if there is a specific time of year when projects can be launched where they are more likely to be funded (need to define seasonally and quarterly somewhere). 
* Find out whether projects with "small" goal amounts are more likely to be successful as compared to projects with "large" goal amounts. (need to define "small" relative to our dataset somewhere; maybe in the dataset section above)
* See if duration impacts whether a project will be successful or not as compared to other duration lengths. 
## To run the code
All the csv files required to run the code are in the following
[Google drive - csvs](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PG1ZG7ye1I1Q20npMgH-UQP4PccTQ_w6/view?usp=sharing) link. The files extracted should be in the same folder as that of the code
